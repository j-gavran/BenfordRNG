  abstract  = {This paper discusses some aspects of selecting and testing random and pseudorandom
number generators. The outputs of such generators may be used in many cryptographic
applications, such as the generation of key material. Generators suitable for use
in cryptographic applications may need to meet stronger requirements than for other
applications. In particular, their outputs must be unpredictable in the absence of
knowledge of the inputs. Some criteria for characterizing and selecting appropriate
generators are discussed in this document. The subject of statistical testing and
its relation to cryptanalysis is also discussed, and some recommended statistical
tests are provided. These tests may be useful as a first step in determining whether
or not a generator is suitable for a particular cryptographic application. However,
no set of statistical tests can absolutely certify a generator as appropriate for
usage in a particular application, i.e., statistical testing cannot serve as a substitute
for cryptanalysis. The design and cryptanalysis of generators is outside the scope
of this paper.},
