# Benford random number generator

### The idea:
Test whether you can use concrete data as a source of random numbers. You can use physical measurements, geographical data (size of cities, lakes, rivers), recent Twitter posts, etc. You probably need to transform the numerical data first to get a more uniform distribution. 

Physical measurements usually have normally distributed noise. If the data spans over several orders of magnitude, Benford's law states that the logarithm of the value, or at least a non-integer part of it, is normally uniformly distributed.
