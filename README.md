# Benford random number generator

### The idea:
Using concrete data as a source of random numbers:
- physical measurements
  - physics constants
  - electron data from CMS
  - muon life times
- recent Reddit posts

If the data spans over several orders of magnitude, Benford's law states that the logarithm of the value, or at least a non-integer part of it, is normally uniformly distributed.
